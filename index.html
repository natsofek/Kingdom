            <h2>The Game's Legacy</h2>
            
            <p class="game-context">
                Kingdom Fate draws its inspiration from the grand strategy and negotiation elements found in classic games like *Diplomacy* and *A Game of Thrones: The Board Game*, combined with the resource management and accessible pathway movement of games like *Ticket to Ride* or *Catan*. We aimed to create a mid-to-heavyweight strategy game where player interaction—through alliances, negotiation, and military might—is as crucial as efficient resource optimization and positional play on the clear, provincial map.
